# CCL Web Refactoring Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for refactoring the CCL Web application to achieve consistent UI design and codebase structure. The refactoring process is organized into phases to ensure systematic implementation and minimal disruption to existing functionality.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

✅ Design system documentation created
- Color system, typography, spacing, and component guidelines established
- Component hierarchy and variant documentation

✅ Utility functions for styling created
- Standardized responsive spacing
- Container sizing
- Grid layouts
- Typography utilities

✅ Core layout components created
- Container components with consistent sizing
- Grid system with responsive variants
- Page layouts with consistent structure

✅ Form component system standardized
- Form layouts with consistent spacing
- Form sections with titles and descriptions
- Form groups for field organization
- Form fields with standardized styling

✅ Data hooks for standardized data fetching
- useData for basic data fetching
- usePagination for paginated data
- useFilteredData for filtered data

✅ URL state management with nuqs
- useUrlParam for individual URL parameters
- useUrlFilters for filter parameters
- useUrlPagination for pagination state

## Phase 2: Component Refactoring (Completed)

### 2.1 Basic Components (Priority: High)
- ✅ Refactor remaining primitive components
  - ✅ Checkbox
  - ✅ Radio
  - ✅ Select
  - ✅ TextArea
  - ✅ Toggle
  - ✅ Switch

### 2.2 Composite Components (Priority: Medium)
- ✅ Refactor dialog components
  - ✅ Dialog
  - ✅ Drawer
  - ✅ Popover
- ✅ Refactor feedback components
  - ✅ Toast
  - ✅ Alert
  - ✅ Progress

### 2.3 Navigation Components (Priority: High)
- ✅ Refactor navigation components
  - ✅ Navbar
  - ✅ Sidebar
  - ✅ Breadcrumbs
  - ✅ Tabs

## Phase 3: Page Structure Refactoring (In Progress)

### 3.1 Layout Implementation (Priority: High)
- ✅ Apply standardized layouts to all pages
  - ✅ Dashboard pages
  - ✅ Admin pages
  - ✅ Auth pages
  - ✅ Form pages

### 3.2 Performance Optimization (Priority: Medium)
- ✅ Implement proper Suspense boundaries
- ✅ Add dynamic loading for non-critical components
- ✅ Optimize image loading

### 3.3 Error Handling (Priority: Medium)
- ✅ Implement consistent error boundaries
- ✅ Create standardized error components
- ✅ Add fallback UI for loading states

## Phase 4: Data Management Refactoring (In Progress)

### 4.1 Server Components (Completed)
- ✅ Standardize data fetching in server components
  - ✅ Create cached data fetching functions
  - ✅ Implement proper error handling
  - ✅ Add automatic authentication handling
- ✅ Identify and convert appropriate components to server components
- ✅ Optimize data loading patterns

### 4.2 Client Components (In Progress)
- ✅ Apply 'use client' directive properly
- ✅ Implement React Query for client-side data fetching
  - ✅ Create standardized data fetching hooks
  - ✅ Set up proper cache invalidation
  - ✅ Implement error handling
- [ ] Standardize event handling

### 4.3 Form Handling (In Progress)
- ✅ Standardize form validation with zod
  - ✅ Create reusable validation schemas
  - ✅ Implement consistent validation patterns
- ✅ Implement consistent form submission handling
  - ✅ Create useFormSubmit hook
  - ✅ Add standardized error handling
  - ✅ Implement redirect and reset functionality
- [ ] Optimize form submission with server actions

## Implementation Approach

### Incremental Rollout
Components will be refactored one at a time, ensuring existing functionality remains intact. Each refactored component will be tested in isolation before being integrated into the application.

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing of each refactored component
- Visual regression testing to ensure UI consistency
- Functional testing to verify behavior

### Documentation
- Update component documentation as refactoring progresses
- Create usage examples for each component
- Document best practices for component usage

## Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Time | Dependencies |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | Completed | None |
| Phase 2: Component Refactoring | Completed | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3: Page Structure | Completed | Phase 2 |
| Phase 4: Data Management | In Progress (3 days remaining) | Phase 3 |

## Success Criteria

- Consistent UI design across all pages
- Improved performance metrics (Web Vitals)
- Reduced code duplication
- Proper separation of server and client components
- Standardized data fetching patterns
- Consistent error handling
